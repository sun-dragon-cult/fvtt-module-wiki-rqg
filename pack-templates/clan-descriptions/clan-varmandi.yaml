        <h2>Clan: Varmandi</h2>
        <p>The Varmandi are a small clan of the Colymar tribe, numbering
        less than 500 members. Their lands are in the Gejay
        Hills between Apple Lane and the Malani tribe, where they
        herd cattle and sheep. The Varmandi have had many violent
        feuds with the neighboring Orlev clan of the Malani tribe.
        Their chief is Korol Serpent-Tongue, who many outsiders
        consider little better than a bandit.</p>
        <p>The clan tattoo is a stylized bear.</p>
