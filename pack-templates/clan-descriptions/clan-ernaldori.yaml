        <h2>Clan: Ernaldori</h2>
        <p>The Ernaldori are the original royal clan of the Colymar tribe.
        Their lands are near Clearwine Fort; as a result they are often
        called the Clearwine Clan. They are a large clan, numbering
        about 1,600 people. Ernalda is the patron deity of the clan,
        and her priestess speaks for the goddess with the entire tribe.
        Baranthos the Old has been clan chieftain since 1602 and is
        responsible for war and dealing with outsiders.</p>
        <p>The clan tattoo is of a snake surrounded by vines.</p>
