        <h2>Homeland: Esrolia</h2>
        <p>This rich and civilized land is ruled by a matriarchy. Esrolia is home to Earth Mother Ernalda and is the center for Earth worship. Nochet, its capital city, is the largest in Glorantha, ruled by the Queen of Esrolia. However, that magnificent city is threatened by the Wolf Pirate fleets, fearsome reavers led by the demigod Harrek the Berserk. Earlier though, these same pirates were instrumental in defeating the Lunar Empire in 1624 and forcing it out of the Holy Country.</p>
        <p>Esrolians think of themselves as civilized, curious, luxurious, and sensual. Their styles set the standards in many lands. They are cosmopolitan, with knowledge of many distant realms. They dislike war, and favor negotiation over open conflict. Foreigners consider Esrolians as proud, ambitious, devious, emotional, and quarrelsome.</p>
