        <h2>Homeland: Grazelands</h2>
        <p>The Grazelands are a region of grassy hills and valleys inhabited by the Pony Breeders. This semi-nomadic tribe herds horses and rules over serfs originally from Esrolia, Sartar, and Tarsh. Their ruler is the Feathered Horse Queen, a powerful Earth priestess. Otherwise, Pony Breeder society is rigid and patriarchal, with everyone’s place determined by age and birth. The tribe is divided into a dozen clans; clan chiefs are elected but few among the populace are eligible. Pony Breeders consider themselves innately superior to all ‘groundsfolk.’</p>
