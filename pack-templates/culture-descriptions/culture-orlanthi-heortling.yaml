        <h2>Culture: Orlanthi (Heortling)</h2>
        <p>The Orlanthi are widely known as the Theyalan culture by outsiders and scholars. The name was given by the God Learners and is taken from the native name for the goddess of the Dawn, Theya, because this seminal culture was so important in the Dawn Age. Although most of the outside world still calls them Theyalans, they usually call themselves Orlanthi, after their own chief god.</p>
        <p>Most Orlanthi are pastoral agriculturalists, free farmers who plow small fields and raise cattle and sheep. Cities tend to be few and small (although some significant exceptions exist, such as the great metropolis of Nochet). Very few people can read; the cult of Lhankor Mhy holds a monopoly over professional scribes.</p>
