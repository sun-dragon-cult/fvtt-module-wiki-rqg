        <p><em><strong>Homo sapiens sapiens</strong></em></p>
        <p>Glorantha has four major human races and several minor ones. There is a good deal of raciallymotivated prejudice, discrimination,
        and intolerance in Glorantha, none of it with any more reason than racism on Earth. However, communications between regions is limited
        in Glorantha, and most people have never seen persons of different racial stocks than their own. When several races share the same region,
        however, racism in all its ugly forms is just as likely as it is on Earth. Several cruel Gloranthan cultures even enslave persons of
        different races.</p>

        <p>Three of Glorantha’s four major human racial types roughly correspond to Earthly equivalents, but the fourth is unique.</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Agimori: a dark-skinned race native to Pamaltela.</li>
        <li>
        Veldang: a blue-skinned race with no Earthly equivalent. Their skin is not bright blue, but slate colored. The Veldang are native
        to Pamaltela, where they are found in Zamokil and Fonrit.
        </li>
        <li>Vithelans: they resemble Earth’s East Asians. They inhabit the East Isles, Kralorela, Teshnos, and Vormain.</li>
        <li>Wareran: a fair to olive-skinned race that inhabit most of Genertela, and Umathela in Pamaltela.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Other minor human or semi-human races also exist, including the green-skinned amphibious Waertagi, pygmies in Pamaltela and Prax,
        and the Teleono people, who are one of six colors. The presence of non-human and semi-human beings on Glorantha can lead to interesting
        assumptions. A person encountering another human of a different race for the first time may assume that he is seeing a creature of a
        different species altogether, with suspicion and fear engendered thereby.</p>
